- All three categories (Employer Discussion, Resources Provided, and Anonymity Protected) showed an upward trend from 2017 to 2020, indicating a positive shift in workplace mental health support due to growing awareness, changing workplace culture, and legal/ethical considerations.
- Employer discussions consistently ranked highest, showing that initiating mental health conversations is crucial to setting the foundation for further support through a proactive approach and stigma reduction.
- Resources provided and anonymity protection also increased but with slightly lower percentages compared to Employer Discussion, emphasizing the importance of offering practical support through counseling and ensuring trust via anonymity.
- A significant rise in all categories in 2020 likely reflected the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased stress, remote work challenges, and empathy, highlighting the need for workplace mental health support.

- **Physical Health Importance**: Consistently rated higher than mental health across all years, reflecting a societal tendency to prioritize physical health over mental health. This is likely due to physical health being more tangible and measurable, while mental health is often stigmatized and dismissed as less important.
- **Mental Health Importance**: 
  - Slight but steady increase from 2017 to 2020, suggesting a gradual shift in employer awareness and recognition of mental health’s importance.
  - The increase may be driven by increased advocacy, awareness campaigns, and a reduction in stigma.
- **Fluctuations in Physical Health Importance**: 
  - Physical health importance rating showed fluctuations, with a peak in 2017 and a slight decrease in 2018 before stabilizing.
  - This could indicate that while physical health remains a priority, its perceived importance may vary due to external factors or evolving workplace priorities.
- **Increase in 2020**: Both physical and mental health importance ratings showed a slight increase in 2020, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the interconnectedness of physical and mental health, prompting employers to address both.
