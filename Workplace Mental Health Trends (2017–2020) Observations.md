**Observations and Conclusions:**

The analysis of mental health trends from 2017 to 2020 reveals several key observations. Family history of mental health disorders remained consistently high across all years, ranging from 48% to 52%, suggesting a strong genetic or familial link. Both past and current mental health disorders showed similar patterns, with a slight increase from 2017 to 2018, possibly due to heightened awareness from movements like #MeToo, followed by a gradual decline from 2018 to 2020. The drop in 2020 was significant, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused widespread stress, isolation, and limited access to mental health services, affecting reporting behaviors. This decline in reported disorders doesn't necessarily reflect a true decrease in mental health issues but may instead be due to external factors like the pandemic.
