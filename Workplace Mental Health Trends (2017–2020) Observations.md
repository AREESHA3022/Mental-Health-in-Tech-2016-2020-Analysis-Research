- All three categories (Employer Discussion, Resources Provided, and Anonymity Protected) showed an upward trend from 2017 to 2020, indicating a positive shift in workplace mental health support due to growing awareness, changing workplace culture, and legal/ethical considerations.
- Employer discussions consistently ranked highest, showing that initiating mental health conversations is crucial to setting the foundation for further support through a proactive approach and stigma reduction.
- Resources provided and anonymity protection also increased but with slightly lower percentages compared to Employer Discussion, emphasizing the importance of offering practical support through counseling and ensuring trust via anonymity.
- A significant rise in all categories in 2020 likely reflected the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased stress, remote work challenges, and empathy, highlighting the need for workplace mental health support.

#### Employer Importance Ratings for Mental and Physical Health Over the Years

- **Physical Health Importance**: Consistently rated higher than mental health across all years, reflecting a societal tendency to prioritize physical health over mental health. This is likely due to physical health being more tangible and measurable, while mental health is often stigmatized and dismissed as less important.
- **Mental Health Importance**: 
  - Slight but steady increase from 2017 to 2020, suggesting a gradual shift in employer awareness and recognition of mental health’s importance.
  - The increase may be driven by increased advocacy, awareness campaigns, and a reduction in stigma.
- **Fluctuations in Physical Health Importance**: 
  - Physical health importance rating showed fluctuations, with a peak in 2017 and a slight decrease in 2018 before stabilizing.
  - This could indicate that while physical health remains a priority, its perceived importance may vary due to external factors or evolving workplace priorities.
- **Increase in 2020**: Both physical and mental health importance ratings showed a slight increase in 2020, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the interconnectedness of physical and mental health, prompting employers to address both.

- **Consistently Low Average Rating**: The average rating for ease of requesting medical leave for mental health issues remains consistently around 3 out of 5 across all years (2017-2020).
- **No Significant Variation**: No noticeable fluctuation or trend over the four years, with the average rating staying stable.
- **Limited Perceived Ease**: A consistent rating of 3 out of 5 suggests that employees find requesting medical leave for mental health issues moderately challenging, indicating hesitation or barriers.
- **Lack of Improvement**: The lack of significant change points to persistent challenges in improving the process, suggesting stigma or procedural barriers:
  - Steady rating implies stigma surrounding mental health may discourage employees from requesting leave.
  - Workplace policies or procedures may not be streamlined or transparent, contributing to the moderate difficulty in requesting leave.
- **Inconclusive Impact of 2020**: Despite increased mental health awareness due to the pandemic, there was no observed change in the ease of requesting leave.

- **Higher Prevalence in Non-Binary Individuals**: Non-binary individuals (gender 3) report the highest rates of both past and current mental health disorders, indicating a potentially higher vulnerability in this group.  
- **Gender Disparities in Mental Health**: Females (gender 2) show a significantly higher prevalence of mental health disorders compared to males (gender 1), suggesting that these conditions disproportionately affect non-male individuals.  
- **Need for Targeted Support**: The data underscores the importance of tailored mental health resources for non-binary and female individuals, highlighting the need for further research to address the contributing factors behind these disparities.
  
#### Gender-based Trends in Openness Regarding Mental and Physical Health Discussions During Interviews
<img src="Openness in Discussing Mental and Physical Health in Interviews by Gender.png" alt="Openness in Discussing Mental and Physical Health in Interviews by Gender" width="600"/>

- **Higher Physical Health Disclosure**  
  - Individuals across all gender groups are significantly more likely to admit to a physical health issue than a mental health issue.
  - This highlights the persistent stigma surrounding mental health.  
- **Non-Binary Individuals Show Highest Mental Health Disclosure**  
  - The non-binary group reports the highest percentage of mental health admissions.  
  - This could be due to greater awareness, community support, rejection of traditional gender norms, and stronger advocacy for mental health.  


#### Gender-based Trends in Comfort Level for Discussing Mental Health Issues with Friends and Family
<img src="Average_Comfort_in_Discussing_Mental_Health_Issues_with_FriendsFamily_by_Gender.png" alt="Average Comfort in Discussing Mental Health Issues with Friends and Family by Gender" width="600"/>

- **Increasing Comfort Trend**: Comfort levels in discussing mental health rise from males to females to non-binary individuals, suggesting that societal norms and support systems influence openness.  
- **Highest Comfort in Non-Binary Group**: Non-binary individuals report the highest comfort levels (~7.1), likely due to stronger community support and acceptance.  
- **Moderate Comfort for Males & Females**: Both groups show moderate comfort, with females slightly higher than males (~6.3), possibly reflecting societal norms that encourage emotional expression in women.  
- **Narrow Rating Range**: The relatively close range of comfort ratings suggests that while gender plays a role, individual experiences and social environments significantly impact comfort levels.  
- **Persistent Stigma**: Despite some openness, moderate ratings indicate lingering stigma, especially among males, who traditionally face societal pressure to avoid discussing mental health.  


#### Gender-based Comfort in Discussing Mental Health and Physical Health Issues
<img src="plot_mh_or_ph_by_gender.png" alt="Comfort in Discussing Mental Health Issues by Gender" width="600"/>

- **Large Comfort Gap**: Physical health discussions are significantly more accepted than mental health across all gender groups.  
- **Persistent Stigma**: Mental health stigma remains strong, limiting open conversations.  
- **Near-Zero Equal Comfort**: Very few individuals feel equally comfortable discussing both mental and physical health.  
- **Non-Binary Individuals More Open**: Group 3 (non-binary) shows slightly higher comfort, possibly due to stronger community support and advocacy.  
- **Limited Progress**: Despite variations, overall mental health comfort remains low, highlighting the need for further efforts to reduce stigma.

### Conclusions on Mental Health Trends
- **Mental Health Prevalence & Stigma**: Despite growing awareness, mental health issues remain widespread, but stigma continues to limit open discussions and support-seeking behavior. Temporary spikes in awareness haven’t led to a sustained cultural shift.
- **Workplace Mental Health Support Improved**: Employers have increasingly provided mental health discussions, resources, and anonymity protection from 2017 to 2020. However, requesting medical leave for mental health remains challenging, indicating procedural and cultural barriers still exist.
- **Gender Disparities in Mental Health**: Non-binary individuals report the highest rates of mental health challenges and also display the most openness in discussing them, likely due to strong community advocacy. Women report higher rates of mental health issues than men, but this may also reflect the fact that men are less likely to acknowledge or seek help for their mental health struggles due to societal expectations discouraging emotional expression.
- **Comfort in Mental Health Discussions Remains Low**: Across all demographics, people are significantly more comfortable discussing physical health than mental health, underscoring the persistent stigma.
- **COVID-19’s Mixed Impact**: While the pandemic increased workplace mental health support, it also created additional stressors, leading to reduced comfort in discussing mental health issues with friends and family.
- **Final Takeaway**: Progress has been made in workplace support, but stigma remains a significant barrier—especially for men, who may struggle in silence. Addressing these issues requires further normalization of mental health discussions, targeted interventions, and policies that make seeking help as acceptable as addressing physical health concerns.
