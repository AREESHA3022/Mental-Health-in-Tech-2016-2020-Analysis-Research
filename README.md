# Workplace Mental Health Analysis (2016â€“2020)

## Overview

This project analyzes mental health trends in the tech industry using sentiment analysis and engagement metrics. It leverages survey data collected by Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) from 2016 to 2020, exploring sentiments around workplace mental health, demographic differences, and trends within the tech sector.

### Dataset

The analysis uses the publicly available Kaggle dataset:

- [**Mental Health in Tech Dashboard (2016-2020)**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sivas1292/mental-health-in-tech-dashboard-2016-to-2020)

## Objectives

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of open-ended responses related to workplace mental health.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Examine mental health trends over the years, highlighting demographic and company-based differences.
3. **Dashboard Visualization**: Present insights through an interactive dashboard (preferred) or clearly documented static visualizations.
4. **Predictive Modeling (Bonus)**: Forecast future trends or identify predictive factors influencing workplace mental health.

## Tasks & Methodology

- **Data Preparation & Exploration**: Clean and preprocess data (handling missing values, noise removal, exploratory data analysis).
- **NLP Sentiment Analysis**: Classify textual survey responses using NLP techniques (e.g., TextBlob, VADER, or transformer models).
- **Trends Analysis**: Analyze workplace mental health trends over time by demographics (gender, age) and company size/type.
- **Visualization**: Create clear visualizations (time-series plots, bar charts, sentiment distribution) to effectively communicate insights.
- **Dashboard Development**: Develop an interactive dashboard (using Streamlit, Dash, etc.), or create detailed static visualizations if interactive deployment isn't feasible.
- **Predictive Modeling (Optional Bonus)**: Implement forecasting (e.g., using ARIMA, Prophet) or machine learning classification/regression models (clearly document and evaluate the model).

## Submission Requirements

Your submission should include:

- **Analysis Report** (PDF): Include introduction, methodology, visualizations, key findings, and insights.
- **Code**: Clearly commented Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for reproducibility.
- **Dashboard** (preferred): Interactive visualizations (provide instructions on local hosting).
- **Video Demonstration** (optional but recommended): Short walkthrough of your dashboard or analysis (hosted on YouTube or Google Drive).
